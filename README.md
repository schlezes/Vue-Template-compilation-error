# Vue-Template-compilation-error

Vue 3 generates a Template compilation error when the <script> tag is contained inside a closing "app" div.

I ran across this error in starting Vue 3.

I added to a previous source code and somehow scrambled the closing div location for the "app" below the script tag.

Thus, the error.

Fortunately, the error was also recorded and solved in StackOverflow.
  
I like to take screenshots of errors so that they might be avoided the next time.
